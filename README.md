# Mathematics of Machine Learining
[Mathematics of Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/site/fagomezj/matem%C3%A1ticas-del-aprendizaje-de-m%C3%A1quinas-2023) is a graduate course taught at the National University of Colombia. This repository contains all the assignments left by [Franciso GÃ³mez](https://sites.google.com/site/fagomezj/home?authuser=0), the course instructor. 
The objective of this course was to give a first approach to the theoretical foundations of Deep Learning. Through this, we tackled recient issues regarding, not only the theoretical breakthroughs, 
but the ethical implications of the use of data, and its applications on the latest problems of the industry.

## Binary Classification
For this assignment we studied two data sets provided by the University of California Irvine, you can check them out [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication) and [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/357/occupancy+detection). 
The goal was to analyze whether or not these data sets are linearly separable, if the data was randomly chose, and if the sample size is enough to guarantee generalization. All of the above was done working with a Support Vector Machine Learning.

## Learning Models
With the previous information, we implemented different models after adjusting the hyperparameters, trying to generalize through cross validation. 

## Face Recognition
We studied PCA using scikit-learn. This algorithm of dimensionality reduction is the best way to represent face images. We searched for the eigenfaces that are most relevant in representing an image.

## Learning from Data
Solutions to specific exercises of Learning from Data, a book by Yaser Abu-Mostafa.

## Theory
Here you will find transcriptions of my class notes, implementation of examples, and certain insights/explanations I found uselfull for understanding thoroughly all the topics. This section is still under construction; hope I can finish it soon.
